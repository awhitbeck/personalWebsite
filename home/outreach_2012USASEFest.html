    The Johns Hopkins Department of Physics and Astronomy is very committed
    to outreach efforts.  The department hosts an <a href="http://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/events/physics_fair/">annual fair</a>
    which exhibits many entertaining and educational demonstrations.  In 
    recent years, I have been responsible for particle physics related 
    demonstrations which include a cloud chamber and a cosmic ray detector.

    In addition to this, myself and others from the high energy physics group
    participate in the 
    <a href="http://www.usasciencefestival.org/">USA Science and Engineering Festival</a> 
    held in Washington, DC.

    This year's science and engineering festival was held at the 
    <a href="http://www.dcconvention.com/">Walter E Washington Convention Center</a>.  
    The exhibit consisted of a cloud chamber, a cosmic ray detector, a cathode-ray, and
    a mock accelerator for kids.  The picture to the left shows our post-doc, Sara
    Bolognesi, and me in behind the cloud chamber and the cathode-ray.
