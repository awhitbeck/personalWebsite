    Together with an undergraduate student we developed a computer model of 
    the cosmic ray detector.  A MC program was written which could model the 
    angular distribution of cosmic ray tracks as well as a visualization 
    which will draw tracks passing through the detector and triggering the 
    photomultipliers (denoted by red cylinders).  The grey rectangles are
    representations of the four scintillators.

    In order to engage kids in our demonstrations we allow them the chance
    to win prizes if they
    take a short trivia quiz in which all the answer can be found somewhere
    in the exhibit, one of which asks for an estimation of the number of
    cosmic rays which pass through ones body in a typical minute.

    To help make the connection to the cosmic ray detector more explicit, 
    we overlayed the animation of the detector on a cartoon person. The 
    simulation of cosmic ray tracks were then drawn through both the detector
    and persons.
