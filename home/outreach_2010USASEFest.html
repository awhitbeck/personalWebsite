    The Johns Hopkins Department of Physics and Astronomy is very committed
    to outreach efforts.  The department hosts an <a href="http://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/events/physics_fair/">annual fair</a>
    which exhibits many entertaining and educational demonstrations.  In 
    recent years, I have been responsible for particle physics related 
    demonstrations which include a cloud chamber and a cosmic ray detector.
    <br> <br>
    In addition to this, myself and others from the high energy physics group
    participate in the 
    <a href="http://www.usasciencefestival.org/">USA Science and Engineering Festival</a> 
    held in Washington, DC.

    In October of 2010 myself and others from JHU participated in the inaugural 
    USA Science and Engineering Festival, which was held on the national mall. 
    As usual, our demonstrations consisted of a cloud chamber, a cosmic ray 
    detector, and a cathode-ray.       
    Our effort were also featured in the <a href="http://cmsinfo.web.cern.ch/cmsinfo/Media/Publications/CMStimes/2010/11_01/index.html">CMS times</a>.
