    I am a particle physicist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, located
    outside of Chicago Illinois, working on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at 
    CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). I recieved my Ph.D. from the Department of Physics 
    and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University, located in Baltimore, in 2013 and my Bachelors 
    in both physics and mathematics from the University of Rochester in 
    2007.

	  Particle physics is one of the most fundamental fields of science.  
	  The major questions we are trying to answer questions that humans
	  have been trying to understand for thousands of years, What is our 
	  universe made of? What are the origins of matter in the universe?

        <p>
	  As a particle physicist I spend my days thinking about how to chip small
	  stones off the large boulder of question that my field is trying to 
	  understand.  Fortunately, this boulder has been model into a beautiful
	  sculpture over the past 100 years worth of scientists asking similar 
	  questions.  This sculpture is often referred to the Standard Model of 
	  particle physics and is a theoretical frame work that has made some of 
	  the most precise predictions of experimental data of scientific field.
	  Yet we only 5% of the universe is described by the Standard Model, 
	  the rest we know exists, namely dark matter and dark energy, but 
	  understand little more than that.  We only know how to incorporate
	  three of the four known forces (the electromagnetic, the weak, the strong, 
	  and the gravitation force) into the Standard Model, gravity being the odd-man 
	  out.  Until recently, we didn't fully understand how any of the
	  fundamental particles (particles that, as far as we can tell are 
	  indivisible) get there mass!  
	</p>

	  Since these question take exstremely large, yet
	  extremely precise machines to create the experimental environment
	  necessary for studying the most fundamental constistuents of matter,
	  particle physicists...
