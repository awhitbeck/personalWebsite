    I am currently working on new project to develop interactive web-based educational toos. 
    I have started with this simple one, which is an animated version of a famous cartoon of
    the standard model of particle physics (see picture above taken from 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">wikipedia</a>...

    This year's science and engineering festival was held at the 
    <a href="http://www.dcconvention.com/">Walter E Washington Convention Center</a>.  
    The exhibit consisted of a cloud chamber, a cosmic ray detector, a cathode-ray, and
    a mock accelerator for kids. The picture to the left shows our ...

    In October of 2010 myself and others from JHU participated in the inaugural 
    USA Science and Engineering Festival, which was held on the national mall. 
    As usual, our demonstrations consisted of a cloud chamber, a cosmic ray 
    detector, and a cathode-ray...

    Together with an undergraduate student we developed a computer model of 
    the cosmic ray detector.  A MC program was written which could model the 
    angular distribution of cosmic ray tracks as well as a visualization 
    which will draw tracks passing ...
