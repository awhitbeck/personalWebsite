    My primary research interests pertain to searches for new particles at
    the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located outside of Geneva, Switzerland.
    As a member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaboration, I have
    been involved in several searches for new particles, including the
    recently discovered particle whose mass is ~125 times the proton's, and 
    detector development projects.

    I am involved in the HCal detector upgrades for the CMS detector.
    My detector work focuses on commissioning hardware for 
    the phase-1 HCal upgrades.  I am currently leading a group of students and
    postdocs to qualify and 
    calibrate the foward hadron calorimeter's frontend electronics before their 
    installation at the end of 2016.  
    <!-- I will 
    continue to monitor and characterize the hardware in situ throughout the 
    coming year to ensure the new electronics are outputting the highest quality 
    data that is possible. //-->

         The HF frontend electronics are responsible for digitizing analog signals
	 from an array of ~3500 channels of photomultiplier tubes (PMT).  When particle showers
	 are induced by the HF cerenkov light is produced in an array of quartz fibers.  
	 The number of photons produced by a particle shower can range from a few to
	 tens of thousands.  This means that the digitizing electronics must be
	 able to precisely measure signals over 5 orders of magnitude and as small as
	 3 fempto-coulombs.  

	 In total, 144 electronic modules, each with 24 highly precise and well 
	 calibrated ASICS and 6 optical transmitters communicating data at 5 Gbps, will
	 be tested, qualified, calibrated, and characterized before being installed
	 into the CMS detector. 

	 I have been a lead researcher on this project directing a groupd of students
	 and postdocs in developing a suite of software which implement concrete tests
	 and measurements to ensure proper quality control.  I have delevoped a detailed
	 plan for ensure that the electronics will meet the required demand of the 
	 LHC environment and the needs of the CMS physics program.  

	 This project has required a broad spectrum of knowledge and skills.<!-- including:

    <h2>Searches for new particles</h2>
    <p>
      My analysis work focuses on multi-jet plus missing energy searches 
      targeting gluino cascade decays. Specifically, I am exploring new 
      data-driven background estimation strategies for inclusive Z production.

    <h2>Precision Higgs property measurements</h2>
    <p>
    During the Ph.D. I played a major role in the discovery of the 
    elusive Higgs boson and went on to develop a suite of tools
    for characterizing the Higgs.  These tools continue to be used
    today to understand whether or not the properties of the Higgs
    boson can tell us about what lies beyond the Standard Model.
    </p>
    <p>
    Although the discovery of the 125 GeV resonance sparked immense 
    interest in the field, at the time of its discovery, physicists knew
    very little about this new particle.  We knew its mass, to within a few percent precision.  
    We knew it was a boson, meaning it has integer spin and not half-integer spin. 
    However, determining this particle's exact role in the Standard Model
    of particle phyics was and is still a major priority in high energy physics.
    My interests lie here, in understanding how different theoretical structures
    manifest themselves in experimental measurables.

	 <h2> Computing large dimensional integrals with Monte Carlo </h2>

	 As an undergraduate I worked in Lynne Orr's high-energy physics (HEP) theory group on
	 Monte Carlo tools.  High dimensional integrals are often hard to compute with 
	 pencil and paper and are common characters in HEP theory calculations.  A common
	 solution to this is using Monte Carlo simulations to random sample points on a 
	 multidimensional curve keeping track of the average until it is found to converge.  
	 
	 working with a postdoc, I learned to derive integrals from feynman diagrams, 
	 pictoral representations of particle interactions which are used in HEP to categorize
	 and scattering processes and derive rates.  These integrals were then 
	 solved numerically using a monte carlo program I wrote in fortran.  

	 This work was the focus of my senior research thesis.  After presenting my work
	 at the senior research seminar, I was awarded the
	 Stoddard Prize.  This work was later a contribution to a peer reviewed article in the
	 journal Physics Review D. This project required knowledge and skill in analytical
	 and numerical computation, written and oral communication stills.
