<h1>Comparisons Plots of Alignments from 2010 Cosmic Data</h1>
<b>Below is a list of alignment and labels for use in later sections.</b>
<br><br>
[1] Alignment starting from MP0064 moving pixel half barrels (6 dof) and pixel end caps (6 dof).
<br>
[2] Alignment starting from Nov09 moving pixel half barrels (6 dof) and pixel end caps (6 dof).
<br>
[3] Alignment starting from MP0064 moving PXB (6 dof), TIB (u v gamma), TOB (u v gamma) Half Barrels as well as PEC (6 dof), TID (u w gamma), TEC (u w gamma).
<br>
[4] Alignment starting from Nov09 moving PXB (6 dof), TIB (u v gamma), TOB (u v gamma) Half Barrels as well as PEC (6 dof), TID (u w gamma), TEC (u w gamma).
<br>
[5] Alignment moving all dets starting with geometry resulting from [2], the dof for the dets are <a href="http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~whitbeck/comparison_plots/det_dof">here.</a>.
